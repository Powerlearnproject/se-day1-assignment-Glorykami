#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software applications in a systematic and reliable manner.
Importance of Software Engineering is to enable creation of software application that drive the modern life and solve impending problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s - Early Programming: The concept of software began when the first computer programs were written using assembly language and machine code.
1968 - Birth of Software Engineering: The term "software engineering" was popularized at a NATO conference, where the need for systematic, disciplined approaches to software development was discussed.
1970s - Waterfall Model: Introduced a sequential development process with defined stages like requirements, design, implementation, testing and maintaining.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Designing. At this stage you identify the problem that is affecting the society.
Building. After identifying the problem, you develop a software that can efficiently solve the problem.
Testing. Once the software is created and all the necessary feature for its running is put into place, you carry a test to accertain its efficiency of the software to handle the problem.
Maintaining. On this stage monitoring is to be carried out on the existing features and upgrades done when necessary.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Model and Agile Method are similar in that they focus on adaptive planning and iterative deveoplment.
Waterfall Model is a standard moddel that sequentially developed through defined stages like design, implementation and testing while Agile Method was merged with scrum and extreme programming that focused on adaptive planning, collaboration and iterative development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is someone who designs the software as per the needs of the team, writes codes in programming language, tests the codes for its efficiency, and maintainsand updates computer programs.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that the software works as expected and problem is detected early so that users have a smooth experience with the final product.
Project Manager is responsible for planning, organizing, and overseeing a project to ensure it is completed on time, within budget, and meets the set goals, involving the stakeholders and coordinating the team. The software developed helps to unify all the information. For Example: Wrike

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are essential tools for developers because they combine written, test, and debug code in one place. For example: Interpreter automatically converts the code into a format the computer understands for easy testing and execution.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential tools in software development because it helps track and manage changes to code over time and acts as backup and recovery of versions of codes.For Example: Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Dealing with Bugs and Errors can be frustrating and time consuming delaying project progress. The solution is to adopt good testing practices, using debugging tools and reviewing codes regularly.:
Rapid Technology evolution makes it hard to stay updates with new tools and practices. The solution is to continously learn and practice new skills through taking courses and reading and participate in developer community.
Dealing with uncollaborative team and poor Communication can lead to inefficiency and conflicts. the solution is to conduct regular meetings, and use collaborative tools like slack for efficient coordination.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing ensures that each part of the code works correctly on its own, catching issues early in development.
Intergration testing identifies issues that occur when integrating different parts of the software, ensuring they interact collaborately.
System Testing ensures the entire software system validates the end-to-end functionality and performance of the application to meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance. Tests are conducted to foresee whether the software meets the userâ€™s needs and requirements, often conducted by the Quality Assurance team, before it is ready for release to the users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and refining the questions (prompts) you give to AI models, like chatgpt to get the most accurate responses.

Prompt engineering interaction with AI models is important as it reduces errors, improves accuracy and efficiency. This engineering involves crafting prompts that clearly and effectively guide the AI to produce relevant outputs.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is coding?
Define coding for the understanding of a first year IT student
Definition of coding for a beginers understanding

The improves prompt is more efficient because it offers clear explanation, simpler interpretation and understandable concept of the information needed.
